# Travel-Ticket-Cancellation-Classification-&-EDA
## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data science project about "Prediction Of Travel Ticket Cancellation". Predicting travel ticket cancellation is crutial for various reasons:
- **Company Profitability**: Anticipating cancellations can significantly impact company profit by optimizing income and enchancing the reputation of the travel agency. This involves strategies to increase income, expand services, and build a larger and better travel brand.
- **Operational Efficiency**: By predicting cancellations, the travel agency can prioritize routes and transportation options that exhibit lower tendencies of ticket cancellations. This leads to improved operational efficiency as resources can be allocated more effectively.
- **Service Regulation**: Understanding the timing of cancellations enables the implementation of effective service regulations. This knowledge can be leveraged to prevent ticket cancellations by creating and enforcing regulations that address common cancellation patterns.
Dataset that used in this project is from kaggle:
